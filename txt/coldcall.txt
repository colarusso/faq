Q(ex_hire): The Legal Innovation and Technology (LIT) Lab is an experiential program combining the vision of Suffolk's Legal Innovation and Technology Institute with the pedagogy and legal services mission of our Clinical Programs. The Lab allows students to work as part of a consultancy focused on legal tech and data science projects. <br><br>If you're looking to work with Spot, our AI-powered issue spotter, you can find just about everything I'd cover in a call <a href="spot.suffolklitlab.org" target="_blank">here</a>. Likewise, you can learn about the Document Assembly Line project <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>We primarily serve non-profit clients, but occasionally we work with for-profits. See <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">our website</a> for more about the Lab. If you want to talk about a potential project, <a href="https://calendly.com/dcolarusso/call" target="_blank">click through here</a> and book a time to talk. 
A: Thanks, bye
	Q(5.1):GOTO:bye

Q(collab): Cool. I love collaboration. Shoot me an email at D Colarusso at Suffolk dot EDU describing what you're thinking. FWIW, here's <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ovuch2YAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">some of my work</a>.
A: Thanks, bye
	Q(6.1):GOTO:bye
A:[javascript:loadQnA('https://colarusso.github.io/faq/cats.html',this.innerHTML)] Can I have cat videos?


Q(background): We'll it's pretty eclectic. You should probably just check out my eponymous website—<a href="http://davidcolarusso.com/" target="_blank">David Colarusso</a>.
A: Thanks, bye
	Q(7.1):GOTO:bye
A:[javascript:loadQnA('https://colarusso.github.io/faq/cats.html',this.innerHTML)] Can I have cat videos?


Q(speaker): The first things you should know is that I don't sit on manels (all-male panels). If you need names, I suggest checking out these lists: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EkEUJFrk4QHh1pHsjdxmftxiYRtM-01HibycpNMe_ik/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Diverse legal tech: POC and Underrepresented People of Legal Tech and Innovation</a> (crowd-sourced) & <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/departments_offices/legal_technology_resources/resources/WomenofLegalTech/" target="_blank">Women of Legal Tech</a> (from the ABA's Legal Technology Resource Center).
A: Of course; that makes sense 
	Q(8.1): If it's for a nonprofit (e.g., legal aid or law school group) in Boston, and I can make it home to read my kids' bedtime stories, I'm inclined to say yes. If travel is involved, I'll probably ask for something to help defer the costs, and if it's for a for-profit, expect a discussion re. speaker's fees.<br><br>You can find some of my old talks <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/talks/" target="_blank">here</a>. Just email D Colarusso at Suffolk dot EDU, and we'll see if it's a good match.

Q(ex_meet): <img src="https://colarusso.github.io/faq/images/tread_lightly.gif" style="width:232px;height:131px;"/><br><br> FWIW, many of my pre-set options lead to a link that will let you book a meeting, but they also include info that might make the need for a call moot.
