Q(speaker): The first things you should know is that I don't sit on manels (all-male panels). If you need names, I suggest checking out these lists: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EkEUJFrk4QHh1pHsjdxmftxiYRtM-01HibycpNMe_ik/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Diverse legal tech: POC and Underrepresented People of Legal Tech and Innovation</a> (crowd-sourced) & <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/departments_offices/legal_technology_resources/resources/WomenofLegalTech/" target="_blank">Women of Legal Tech</a> (from the ABA's Legal Technology Resource Center).
A: Of course; that makes sense 
	Q(14.1): If it's for a nonprofit (e.g., legal aid or law school group) in Boston, and I can make it home to read my kids' bedtime stories, I'm inclined to say yes. If travel is involved, I'll probably ask for something to help defer the costs, and if it's for a for-profit, expect a discussion re. speaker's fees.<br><br>You can find some of my old talks <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/talks/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Q(ex_meet): <img src="https://colarusso.github.io/faq/images/tread_lightly.gif" style="width:232px;height:131px;"/><br><br> FWIW, many of my pre-set options lead to a link that will let you book a meeting, but they also include info that might make the need for a call moot.
